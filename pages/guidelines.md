### 1. Storytelling
Every course should have an engaging, continuous narrative – for example,
based on real-life applications (_“predicting the weather”_), historical
events (_“measuring the height of Mount Everest”_), a mathematical puzzle
(_“which shapes tessellate”_) or even fictional characters. After starting
with some general exposition, we should arrive at a new problem that students
can’t solve, and then develop new mathematics that’s required. There could
even be some suspense: students don’t initially know where the story might
lead, and are later surprised with a powerful mathematics result. At every
point, students should understand the reason for what they are learning.

### 2. Exploration and Open Play
 Whenever possible, a new topic should be introduced with a open-ended
environment where students can explore, discover some initial concepts,

### 3. User Interactions
 Every Mathigon course is divided into small steps. Usually, these should not
be longer than 2-3 paragraphs of text, and at every step, there needs to be
something to do for the user.

### 4. Questions
 Avoid asking students direct questions (_“What is the sum of 3 and 4?”_) and
instead write a statement that students have to complete (*“The sum of 3 and
4 is ___.”*).

### 5. Tone and Pronouns
 Overall, the tone should be kept as neutral and factual as possible. Rather
than referring directly to the author (“I”) or student (“you”), assume that
you are working together (“we” or “let’s”). This allows students to feel more

### 6. Illustrations and Graphics
As you are scrolling though a course, the browser viewport should always
contain some colour like illustrations or diagrams (excluding very small
screens like phones). Diagram style (not hand-drawn, etc.)

### 6. Inline Elements
TODO - Links between text and graphics, highlights in text

### 7. Use of Colours 
TODO - text/diagrams match

### 8. Questions and Clanks
TODO - simple, number, range, etc.

### 9. List and Table Data
TODO -  Structured data should never be represented in a long sentence: use
tables or bullet lists instead.

### 10. Writing Style
TODO - Lots of small paragraphs, short sentences, etc.
